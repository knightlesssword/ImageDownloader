<b>Imgur Image Downloader</b>

![alt text](https://s.imgur.com/images/logo-1200-630.jpg?2)

This is a tool/ script written in python using which you can download images from Imgur.com site.
Using reddit's subreddit.

Working:
  1. Give your desired subreddit name along with the prefix to it (eg. r/cute)
  2. The page system is because I haven't completely mastered python yet. One page as input gives the option to download around 60 images at a stretch.
  3. Please be patient if you've given a large amount of pages as the script is basic and tends to be slow.
  4. This may become unresponsive at times and may crash due to timeout or other internet errors.

<i>This is the working run from Windows Power Shell</i>

I will try to update various elements as I go, feel free to commit any changes or inform any issues, do remember this is a basic tool! :)

Happy downloading!
